                    <h1>The Taj Mahal - India, Built In 1643 CE</h1>
                    <p>The Taj Mahal welcomes an astonishing 35 to 40 thousand visitors every day — and with busy
                        seasons, it is no stranger to up to 8 million visitors annually. The origin of this marbled
                        expression of love lies in the celebrated reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan 400 years ago. This
                        leader had a desire to build a monument to the object of his affection and favorite wife, Mumtaz
                        Mahal. Ultimately, it exists as a tomb for her, but she is certainly one of the few people who
                        will not be forgotten as time goes by.</p>

                    <h1>The Great Wall Of China - China, Built In 700 BCE</h1>
                    <p>A creation that serves as one of the largest archives of historical documents and a morgue, the
                        Great Wall of China has gone far beyond its original purpose as just a defensive measure. Let's
                        unpack that: because it was in construction for nearly 2,000 years by separate dynasties,
                        inscriptions, and corpses are carved and buried onto and into this megalithic icon. Furthermore,
                        tourist hype forced Chinese authorities to implement a daily limit of 65,000 visitors in places
                        like the Badaling section of the Great Wall. It is hard to estimate the total annual visitors
                        due to it being 5,500 miles (8,851 km) long, but around 150 million inbound tourists visit
                        Beijing each year, and travel bloggers frequently claim that almost all tourists visiting
                        Beijing are planning to check out the wall.</p>

                    <h1>The Colosseum - Italy, Built In 80 CE</h1>
                    <p>Emperors are addicted to cementing their legacy by constructing incredible wonders, and the
                        relationship between Emperor Vespasian and the Colosseum he commissioned is no different. The
                        project was so grand that it was his son Titus' responsibility to complete it, and Emperor
                        Domitian earned a little credit by making substantial modifications. Roman concrete, limestone,
                        and volcanic rock were essential ingredients to this 50,000-spectator arena, and earthquakes and
                        stone thieves tried and failed to tear it down.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, a legend once existed regarding a carved urn in the Treasury facade: Bedouin
                        sharpshooters left bullet holes across it hundreds of years ago, believing that it held
                        priceless riches within. The original occupants were also religious, and several of the carved
                        buildings, like the Monastery and High Place of Sacrifice, were designed for ritual. More
                        recently, the abandoned city has been the site of films like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
                        If you stumble across the complex today, a group of resilient people still reside in the carved
                        homes, peddling crafts and offering rides on camels and horses.

                    <h1>Chichén Itzá - Mexico, Built In 600 CE</h1>
                    <p>This site is a golden example to prove that Egyptians were not the only ones capable of
                        constructing enormous pyramids. The largest structure, El Castillo, is 98 feet and utilizes 365
                        stone steps to represent the solar year. The Maya people went beyond just sheer scale: during
                        the equinoxes, a mystical shadow appears due to ingenious engineering, and a serpent's shadow
                        appears to slither down the staircase. Naturally, this attention to detail means that the whole
                        area was a religious, political, and economic center for the Mayan civilization that seems to
                        have vanished overnight, abandoning all settlements by 900 CE. Stone tools were enough to create
                        this 5 km2 complex, which is one of the reasons it fits as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
                        Astronomy and acoustics were common sciences in this city, which is fitted with an ancient
                        observatory, and whispers at one end of the Ball Court can be heard 135 meters away at the other
                        end. Human sacrifices were performed here, but thankfully, its 3 million yearly visitors will
                        not have to witness those extinct practices.</p>

                    <h1>Christ The Redeemer - Brazil, Built In 1931 CE</h1>
                    <p>The Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro is an awe-inspiring symbol of both faith and
                        architectural brilliance. Overlooking the city from atop Mount Corcovado, this religious icon is
                        visited by almost 2 million people per year. Initiated in the period following World War I, its
                        creation from 1926 to 1931 was a collective endeavor involving Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos
                        Oswald, and Paul Landowski. With a striking height of 98 feet and its arms reaching 92 feet
                        wide, it's a marvel to behold. The base further elevates its grandeur by 26 feet. Made of
                        reinforced concrete and embellished with over six million tiles, this statue is recognized as
                        the world's most prominent Art Deco figure. Despite weather challenges, like lightning strikes,
                        it remains steadfast, only once suffering damage to Jesus's right thumb in 2014. From almost any
                        location in Rio, its silhouette can be discerned, providing incredible views and drawing both
                        believers and admirers. Its significance and beauty rightfully earn it a place among the world's
                        most revered landmarks.</p>

                    <h1>Machu Picchu - Peru, Built In 1450 CE</h1>
                    <p>Can you imagine the astonishment of those who discovered this metropolis, seemingly floating on
                        clouds between mountains? The Machu Picchu, perched high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is a
                        stone's throw from Cuzco. Although it was well known to the local people, the West took note of
                        it in 1911 when it was spotted by the American explorer Hiram Bingham. It was initially believed
                        to be Vilcabamba, a hidden Incan haven during the Spanish resistance. The genuine intent behind
                        this 15th-century structure, however, remains debated, with suggestions that it served as a
                        sanctuary for the revered 'Virgins of the Sun,' a place of worship, or perhaps a regal escape.
                        Notwithstanding its remote and towering position, travelers can step back in time amidst
                        meticulously preserved Incan edifices showcasing farming terraces, open squares, living
                        quarters, and skillfully designed shrines. Erected around 1450 as an imperial commission under
                        Inca ruler Pachacuti, the site mesmerizes onlookers with its smooth, dry-stone construction and
                        breathtaking vistas of the encompassing valley.</p>
